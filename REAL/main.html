        <h3>Why you should get a fish as a pet</h3>
        <p>
          If you are thinking about getting fish, perhaps as an ideal first pet
          for children or a low-maintenance addition to your home, fish are the
          perfect solution. From stress-relief to fun decor, here are 10 reasons
          you should keep fish as pets and why an aquarium could be the ideal
          new addition to your home.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Fish Are One of the Most Low-maintenance Pets you Can Find</h3>
        <p>
          If you are looking for a family pet to join your household, fish are
          the perfect match. With relatively little upkeep required when
          compared to other household pets such as cats and dogs, fish are an
          ideal pet for both busy households and those wanting to introduce a
          simpler pet to younger children
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Keeping Fish As Pets Could Help Lower Stress Levels</h3>
        <p>
          Keeping fish in an aquarium or pond in your home or garden is a great
          stress-reliever. Fish are known to have a calming effect on those
          watching them and just seeing them glide about the tank is a sure-fire
          way to lower your stress levels and create a more tranquil space in
          your home.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Keeping Fish is a Great Learning Opportunity for Children</h3>
        <p>
          They may be one of the lowest maintenance pets to keep but fish are
          also a fantastic learning opportunity for kids. Learning how to care
          for an animal is a great life lesson with lots of activities to get
          children of all ages involved in.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Aquarium Fish Don't Take up Much Space</h3>
        <p>
          One of the best things about keeping fish is that you can choose a
          fish tank size that fits your home. Whether you just have enough room
          for a small goldfish bowl or want a sprawling aquarium to fill the
          length of a room, the choice is yours.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>There Are Lots of Ways to Decorate your Fish Tank</h3>
        <p>
          From a kaleidoscope of colours to choose from for plants to the
          fantastic range of fish tank ornaments available for your aquarium,
          whether you are looking to recreate a lost underwater city, wacky
          racers or a simpler, plant-based design, there is an aquarium
          decoration for you. Decorating your fish tank is lots of fun and the
          perfect way to update the room in which you are storing it
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Fish Can Improve Productivity</h3>
        <p>
          If you have found yourself working from home due to the pandemic, a
          fish tank could be exactly what you need to boost your productivity.
          Studies have shown that as well as reducing anxiety and helping
          patients with Alzheimer's, having a fish tank in a workplace can
          vastly improve productivity.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>If Silence is Golden, Fish Are Your Friend</h3>
        <p>
          Whilst it may be obvious, fish are the perfect pet for those who value
          their peace and quiet. When setting up an aquarium in your home,
          you'll get all of the added benefits of a mesmerising show, without
          the need for loud noises and mess.

        <p>
          Guppies have been a staple of the aquarium hobby for generations.
          Originating in tropical pools in South America and the Caribbean
          Islands, these fish are now available in a wide variety of colors that
          have been produced by selective breeding at fish farms. Many guppy
          keepers may start out with only one or two fish, but being
          live-bearers with long-term sperm storage, you may be in for a full
          tank before long.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Origins and Distribution</h3>
        <p>
          The guppy has been captive bred for over 100 years, but originally
          came from South America. They are named for Robert John Lechmere Guppy
          who collected these fish on the island of Trinidad in 1866. They are
          native to freshwater streams in the north of South America, including
          Surinam, Guyana and Venezuela, and the Caribbean islands, including
          Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago. Now, they have been introduced to every
          continent but Antarctica and can be found in many warm waterways
          around the world
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Colors and Markings</h3>
        <p>
          There are countless color varieties of guppies. Males have more
          vibrant colors than females, and have longer caudal and dorsal fins.
          Depending on the variety, some guppies have short, rounded tails, some
          "V"-shaped and others can have an elongated tail half the length of
          their body. Tail fins may have a marbled or striped appearance, or the
          fish may be all one or two colors. Whatever color combination you can
          dream, there is probably a perfect guppy for you.
          <br />
          Many websites and some pet stores will offer "select" or "unique"
          varieties found nowhere else. Many times, these strains are the result
          of serious inbreeding and produce fish with compromised immune
          function and shorter life spans. Try to stick to the mainstream
          varieties with well-established lineages. If you end up breeding two
          different strains, you may be surprised how the color variations mix.

        <p>
          In the cruel pet trade, betta fish (aka “Siamese fighting fish”) are
          fighting for their lives. Pet shops, discount superstores, florists,
          and even websites sell bettas who are forced to live in minuscule
          cups, small bowls, and even flower vases. Many people who buy these
          fish on a whim don't know enough—if anything—about proper betta care,
          which is more complex and expensive than they realize. On this page,
          learn why you should never buy bettas (or any other animal) from a pet
          store. If you already have a betta fish companion, we'll show you how
          to give that animal the best possible life.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>What's in a Name?</h3>
        <p>
          While you may see bettas referred to as “Siamese fighting fish” or
          “labyrinth fish,” their scientific name is Betta splendens. No matter
          what they're called, these fish are sensitive and complex individuals
          who suffer greatly when exploited in the pet trade.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Betta Fish Facts</h3>
        <p>
          Betta fish are native to Asia, where they live in the shallow water of
          marshes, ponds, or slow-moving streams. Male bettas are devoted
          fathers who build bubble nests for their young with their mouths and
          fiercely protect their babies from predators. Just like us, betta fish
          are diurnal. That means they're active during the day and sleep at
          night, requiring darkness to get a good night's rest.
          <br />
          While some bettas are captured in the wild, the vast majority of those
          sold in the U.S. come from breeding farms in Thailand and other
          countries in Southeast Asia, where it's common practice to keep them
          in small bottles. When it's time to pack them for transport to the
          U.S., fish are haphazardly dumped into baskets covered with nets and
          scooped up into small plastic cups.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>What Do Bettas Eat?</h3>
        <p>
          Plant roots aren't adequate food for betta fish. Bettas are
          carnivorous animals who, in nature, eat mostly insects and insect
          larvae. A diet consisting solely of plant roots may keep them alive
          for a while, but since it lacks the proper nutrients for this species,
          the fish eventually become sick and die.
          <br />
          Don't overfeed fish. Too much uneaten food and waste material in
          aquarium tanks can overload them, causing ammonia and nitrite levels
          to become toxic. If you already have a betta or other companion fish,
          remember that you should provide only as much food as they can eat in
          about three minutes.

          goldfish, (Carassius auratus), ornamental aquarium and pond fish of
          the carp family (Cyprinidae) native to East Asia but introduced into
          many other areas. The goldfish resembles the carp (Cyprinus carpio)
          but differs from its relative in having no mouth barbels. It was
          domesticated by the Chinese at least as early as the Sung dynasty
          (960–1279). The goldfish is naturally greenish-brown or gray. The
          species, however, is variable, and numerous abnormalities occur. A
          deviant fish may be black, spotted, golden, white, or white with
          silver; it may have a trilobed tail fin or protruding eyes; or it may
          lack the normally long dorsal fin. Centuries of selecting out and
          breeding such abnormal specimens have produced over 125 breeds of
          goldfish, including the common, pet-shop comet; the veiltail, with a
          three-lobed, flowing tail; the lionhead, with a swollen “hood” on the
          head; and the celestial, with protruding, upward-directed eyes.
        </p>
        <h2>How to take care of Gold Fish?</h2>
        <h3>Temperature</h3>
        <p>
          Goldfish are considered a cold-water species of fish but can also be
          kept successfully at warmer temperatures. Fancy goldfish can be kept
          between 68-74 F, while some varieties such as comets or shubunkins can
          be kept in a wider range from 60-70 F. Often, goldfish can be kept at
          water temperatures that are similar to room temperature and do not
          require supplemental heat.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Water Quality</h3>
        <p>
          Good water quality is critical for keeping a goldfish healthy. The pH
          should range between 7-8.4 and temperatures should be kept in a narrow
          range. Water should be tested frequently and an aquarium should be
          cycled before adding any animals. Water quality test kits are
          available to test weekly when you have a freshwater fish tank.
          <br />
          Water aeration is vital to maintain oxygen levels within their
          habitat, which can be provided with an air pump and air stone.
          Filtration is also important to help remove any food items and feces
          from the environment. This will also keep the habitat clean for
          display.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Size and Enrichment</h3>
        <p>
          Goldfish should be kept in the largest possible habitat available.
          Habitat size should be dependent on the variety of goldfish and the
          full-grown size of the fish. A goldfish, depending on type, can be
          housed in a habitat that provides about 10-20 gallons of water per
          fish. Some of the larger varieties of fish require a larger amount of
          space. In some cases, goldfish of the varieties like orandas, ryukins,
          and moors should be kept outside in ponds. <br />
          Goldfish habitats can be enriched to make them more naturalistic with
          live plants, however its important to remember that goldfish may
          decide to eat some of the live plants since they are omnivores. Some
          plant species that grow fast and can outgrow a hungry goldfish are
          Vallisneria spp, Anubias, Java fern, and Cryptocoryne. <br />
          Substrate can be used for goldfish habitats to make the bottom of the
          enclosure look more realistic. Ensure the substrate is larger than
          what the fish can eat. Some starter kits are available that will help
          get you started with your aquarium. <br />
          An old misconception about goldfish is that they can thrive in small
          bowls. This is not true. Goldfish can survive some of the toughest
          environments and adapt quite well, but small enclosures such as bowls
          limit the ability of a goldfish to thrive in captivity. Often,
          goldfish are not provided adequate water quality, aeration, and an
          enriching environment in these habitats. These small habitats limit
          the animal's ability for them to display their natural behaviors and
          move freely.
